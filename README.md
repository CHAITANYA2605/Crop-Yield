Observations

Accuracy:

All models exhibit low accuracy (~0.77%) across configurations, suggesting that the task is challenging, or the dataset may require further preprocessing or feature engineering.

MAE:

The lowest MAE is achieved by the No Regularization Model (11.92), though it may be prone to overfitting.

Regularization introduces a slight increase in MAE (13.28) but can help generalization.

Models using CNNs show higher MAE, potentially due to hyperparameter tuning or architecture optimization requirements.

Loss:

Regularization reduces the loss in non-CNN models but increases it in CNN-based models. This might indicate a need for fine-tuning regularization techniques.
