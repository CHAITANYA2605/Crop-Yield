# Model Performance Analysis

This repository explores the performance of different machine learning models on a given dataset. We evaluate models with and without regularization, as well as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Overview

## Models Evaluated:

No Regularization Model
Regularized Model
No Regularization Model (using CNN)
Regularized Model (using CNN)
Key Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average prediction error.
Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.
Loss: Model performance during training.
Results Summary

Model	MAE (Test)	Accuracy	Loss (Training)
No Regularization Model	11.92	0.77%	29,716.20
Regularized Model	13.28	0.77%	21,763.90
No Regularization Model (using CNN)	15.04	0.77%	102,822.59
Regularized Model (using CNN)	22.73	0.77%	161,529.11

Observations

Accuracy: All models exhibit low accuracy (~0.77%), indicating a challenging task or potential issues with the dataset (e.g., insufficient preprocessing, feature engineering).
MAE:
The No Regularization Model achieves the lowest MAE (11.92) but may overfit.
Regularization slightly increases MAE (13.28) but improves generalization.
CNN models have higher MAE, likely due to suboptimal hyperparameters or architecture.
Loss: Regularization generally reduces loss in non-CNN models but increases it in CNN models, suggesting a need for fine-tuning regularization techniques.

Future Improvements

Optimize hyperparameters to improve MAE and accuracy.
Experiment with additional regularization techniques (dropout, batch normalization).
Augment the dataset to enhance generalization.
Implement cross-validation for more robust performance metrics.
